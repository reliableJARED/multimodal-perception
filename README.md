# Multimodal Perception

A comprehensive collection of examples and code snippets for vision and audio models designed to analyze environmental content. This repository serves as a development workspace for building a unified multimodal perception system that combines state-of-the-art computer vision and audio processing capabilities.

## 🎯 Project Goal

The ultimate objective is to integrate multiple specialized models into a single, cohesive multimodal system capable of understanding and analyzing complex environmental scenes through both visual and auditory information.

## 🧠 Models & Technologies

### Vision Models
- **MiDAS** - Monocular depth estimation for 3D scene understanding
- **Moondream2** - Vision-language model for image understanding and captioning
- **SAM (Segment Anything Model)** - Universal image segmentation
- **YOLO** - Real-time object detection and classification

### Audio Models
- **Qwen-Audio** - Large-scale audio-language understanding
- **Whisper** - Automatic speech recognition and transcription
- **SpeechBrain** - Speech processing and analysis toolkit
- **Silero-VAD** - Voice activity detection

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+
- CUDA-compatible GPU (recommended)
- Sufficient RAM for model loading (16GB+ recommended)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/reliableJARED/multimodal-perception.git
cd multimodal-perception
```

2. Create a virtual environment:
```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies (choose based on your needs):
```bash
# For vision models only
pip install -r requirements/vision.txt

# For audio models only
pip install -r requirements/audio.txt

# For complete system
pip install -r requirements/full.txt
```

## 💡 Usage Examples

### Individual Model Testing
```bash
# Test YOLO object detection
python vision/yolo/detect_objects.py --input data/sample_images/scene.jpg

# Test Whisper speech recognition
python audio/whisper/transcribe.py --input data/sample_audio/speech.wav

# Test MiDAS depth estimation
python vision/midas/estimate_depth.py --input data/sample_images/scene.jpg
```

### Multimodal Integration
```bash
# Run complete environmental analysis
python integration/multimodal/analyze_environment.py \
    --video data/sample_video.mp4 \
    --output results/analysis.json
```

## 🔧 Development Workflow

1. **Individual Model Development**: Start with single-model implementations in their respective directories
2. **Testing & Validation**: Use sample data to verify model performance
3. **Integration Planning**: Design interfaces for model combination
4. **Multimodal Implementation**: Develop unified system in `integration/` directory
5. **Optimization**: Fine-tune performance and resource usage
